,,,"- GPT-3.5 achieved a state-of-the-art F1 score of 83.8 on the joint aspect term extraction and polarity classification task, surpassing previous models. - Fine-tuned GPT-3.5 outperformed the state-of-the-art InstructABSA model, showing the effectiveness of fine-tuning for ABSA tasks. - Detailed prompts improved performance in zero-shot and few-shot settings, but were not necessary for fine-tuned models. - Errors were related to benchmark dataset rules, with fine-tuned models showing fewer errors and better performance. - Fine-tuned models were more cost-efficient compared to GPT-4 in real-world applications.","- Evaluated GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 performance on SemEval-2014 dataset for ABSA. - Tested various prompts, in-context examples, and fine-tuning using F1 score as the performance metric. - Analyzed error types and cost-efficiency of different model versions. - Used JSON schema for structured output format and OpenAI API for fine-tuning."
,,,"- Proposed the Transformer, a network architecture based solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrence and convolutions. - Transformer models showed superior quality in machine translation tasks, outperforming existing models, including ensembles, with faster training times and better parallelizability. - Achieved a BLEU score of 28.4 on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task and 41.8 on the English-to-French task, establishing new state-of-the-art scores. - Generalized well to other tasks such as English constituency parsing, achieving competitive results with minimal task-specific tuning.","- Introduced the Transformer model architecture based on stacked self-attention and point-wise fully connected layers for both encoder and decoder. - Used multi-head attention mechanism for global dependencies between input and output. - Employed residual connections and layer normalization in the encoder and decoder stacks. - Utilized positional encodings to provide information about the order of tokens in the sequence. - Trained models on the WMT 2014 English-German and English-French datasets using the Adam optimizer with variable learning rates and label smoothing. - Experimented with variations in model architecture, such as different numbers of attention heads and key dimensions, to evaluate performance. - Conducted experiments on English constituency parsing tasks to assess the generalization of the Transformer model to other tasks. - Provided attention visualizations to demonstrate the model's ability to learn dependencies and perform syntactic and semantic tasks."
